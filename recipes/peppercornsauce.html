            <h4><strong><em>Ingredients</em></strong></h4>   
                <ul>
                    <li>1 tbsp butter</li>
                    <li>2 large shallots, finely chopped</li>
                    <li>3 tsp green peppercorns, in brine, drained</li>
                    <li>3 tbsp brandy</li>
                    <li>100 ml red wine</li>
                    <li>200ml good-quality beef stock</li>
                    <li>4 tbsp double cream</li>

                    <h4><strong><em>Steps!</em></strong></h4>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Put the butter in a large, high-sided frying pan, then fry the shallots and peppercorns over a medium heat for 5 mins, until the shallots have softened but not browned. Add the brandy and cook until it has reduced away to almost nothing.</li>
                            <li>Pour the wine into the pan, turn up the heat and boil rapidly until reduced by half. Add the stock and reduce again, this time by two-thirds, this will take around 5 mins. Stir the cream into the sauce and allow it to thicken slightly. Check the sauce is seasoned to your liking before serving with steak.</li>
